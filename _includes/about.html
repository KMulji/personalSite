        <p>Creating innovative software applications to spiral global change is my passion and outlook in life as I
          progress towards building a career as a software engineer. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science
          (magna cum laude, with high honors) from Clark University USA. I am skilled in C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML,
          CSS, Jekyll, Bootstrap 4 and full stack development using MERN stack. </p>

        <p>Social impact is close to my heart which
          led me to develop a website for www.houseofhopekenya.org as my honors project using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 4
          and Jekyll to raise awareness of the less privileged orphaned street boys in Kenya my home Country, and which
          I have been supporting for the last 7+ years. Further, to broaden my understanding of the business world, I
          have experience as a Product Manager for an upcoming lubricant company within the oil & energy industry.</p>
